# That's where we add da heading right?

md test post idk how it'll be. do note this is just a test so just trying to type on and on and on.

## subheading test, well here it goes.

Not too bad ig, but ok, let's just go on and on and on typing. that reminds me of a song in which on and on and on comes. idk, forgot which song. this is getting too long, better test some bold and italic font.

**bold md please work, i hope you are working, if not then it is a punishable offence. ok, maybe not that much also, but yeah. bold over, into italic**

*i'm 100% sure there are like a million of spelling and other errors here, but after all it's just a test so who care in 'ere (oh wait ere is before, so better change that to here). well ig itallic is fine now*

[link adding time](https://lichess.org/) hope it works --\_(:/)_/-- ig that's how it's done.
